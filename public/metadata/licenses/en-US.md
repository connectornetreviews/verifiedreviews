# II - Content of the Client Terms of Service

## 1 - These Terms are a Contract

These Terms are a contract between Net Reviews and the business or organization that completes
the process of registering for a client account and becomes enabled to utilize the Service (the
“Client”), as described in more detail below. (Note that we will sometimes refer to Net Reviews in
these Terms as “we,” “us” or “our” and to our Client as “you” or “your”.) When you commence a trial or
paid subscription, the individual acting on behalf of Client is representing to Net Reviews that such
individual has the necessary authority to enter into these Terms and legally bind Client, so please
ensure that representation is true before proceeding.
These Terms include not only the contractual terms set forth herein, but also include (i) each order
form or other written offline agreement that may be entered into between Client and Net Reviews by
the execution by an authorized officer thereof (an “Order Form”), (ii) all operating rules, policies and
guidelines that are referred to herein or that may otherwise be published by Net Reviews on its
websites (collectively, the "Guidelines"), and (iii) the provisions of our Privacy Policy, all of which are
incorporated as part of these Terms. You acknowledge and agree to be legally bound by these Terms,
as they may be modified from time to time by Net Reviews, by accessing or continuing to use the
Service.
Please note that each individual who uses the Service on behalf of a Client also must agree to be
bound by our User Requirements, which provides additional contract terms governing each individual’s
access and use of the Service.

## 2 - Privacy Policy

All information Net Reviews obtains from you or a Consumer in connection with your use of the
Service will be treated according to the provisions of our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated as part
of these Terms. Your use of the Service indicates your acknowledgement and acceptance that the
information you provide to us will be governed by such Privacy Policy, as it may be updated from time
to time.

## 3 - Initiating the Service

### 3.1. Obtaining a Subscription

Each Client must obtain a subscription to access and use the Verified Reviews Service. A subscription
may be procured through the Service interface at our web site or, in some cases, via an Order Form
entered into by Client and Net Reviews. Each subscription is for a specified term and the pricing for
Client’s selection will vary, as described below.

### 3.2. Communicating through the Service

Client determines how to initiate and setup Verified Reviews in its online environment. Client may elect
to install a software module in its systems that interoperates with most e-commerce platforms, or take
advantage of Verified Reviews’ API to enable integration between Client’s and Verified Reviews’
systems. While we provide guidance and resources for Client to utilize in connection with the initiation,
Client bears sole responsibility for the correct installation and integration of its systems with Verified
Reviews. Client may also elect to securely transmit information relating to its products, services, and
customer interactions through another mutually acceptable mode of transmission to us.
Client may use the Service to solicit Client’s customers (we call “Consumers”) and collect from the
Consumers their opinions about Client’s products, services, support and other experiences, or any
other action on which feedback can be given (which we collectively refer to as “Reviews”). Client may
also engage in a conversation with its Consumers through use of the Service.


### 3.3. Client’s “Back Office”

Subscriptions commence upon the earlier of your subscription for the Service or when we make
available a specific "Back Office" accessible to you and your Authorized Users who may log-in with
your specific username and password (the “Back Office”). You are responsible for ensuring all Client-
related information in the Back Office is accurate and complete. The Back Office provides access to a
variety of Client account information, Consumer information, and all Reviews and associated
communications, as well as a variety of tools made available by Net Reviews to enable Client to utilize
the Service (including Service – related statistics) for which it has obtained a subscription. Client shall
ensure that its log-in credentials are secured and shall be solely responsible with respect to actions
taken by anyone accessing the Back Office using Client’s credentials, including, without limitation, any
compromise or disclosure of personal information of Consumers that may have been obtained or
divulged via Client’s Back Office. Client must inform Net Reviews immediately if they suspect any
disclosure of any Authorized User’s credentials or any improper access of the Back Office, so that Net
Reviews may take appropriate measures to remedy said security breach. Net Reviews reserves the
right to suspend access to the Back Office at any time and without prior notice in order to prevent or
mitigate any suspected improper access to or use of the Back Office.

### 3.4. Widgets

Client may also obtain graphical widgets to display on the pages of Client’s website containing Client’s
overall rating based upon aggregate Reviews in conjunction with the Verified Reviews logo (a
“Widget”). Client may obtain a fixed Widget that is integrated into Client’s visual style guide, in which
case Client is solely and entirely responsible for the choice, integration and display of such Widget, in
which event we shall not have any responsibility if the visual representation of the Widget on Client's
website differs from that created and made available by Verified Reviews. Client may elect to obtain a
floating Widget with Verified Reviews’ style guide that Client shall not modify.

## 4 - Using the Service

### 4.1. User Management

Client determines which individuals within Client’s organization are authorized to use the Service
under Client’s account to access and take actions in the Back Office (each such user being an
“Authorized User”). For example, you may provision or deprovision access for individual Authorized
Users of the Service, manage the solicitation, collection and publication of Reviews and the
communications with Consumers, and enable or disable the publication of Reviews on third-party web
sites or services. Client shall ensure that it disables publication of Reviews if it does not want Reviews
available to the public. Client is responsible for (i) informing Authorized Users of all Client policies and
practices that are relevant to their use of the Service and of any settings that may impact the
processing of Reviews and (ii) ensuring all Authorized Users comply with these Terms, including the
User Requirements.

### 4.2. Consumer and Service Management

Client determines the manner in which to use the Service to solicit Consumer participation in providing
Reviews, whether the Reviews are publicly available, and the nature of Consumer communications
that may be accessed, communicated, and published using the Service. Client also determines
whether to enable the display of aggregate ratings and links for Consumer Reviews on third-party
search engines and other services with which Net Reviews has business relationships. Client agrees
that, having made such determinations, it shall utilize the Service to request Reviews from all of its
Consumers who purchase any products or services from Client during the term of its Service
subscription.
Client is responsible for obtaining all rights, permissions, and consents from Consumers that are
necessary to legally share Consumer information with us, and to grant the rights and licenses in these
Terms that we rely upon in order to communicate with the Consumer and provide the Service. Without


limiting the foregoing, your privacy policy and/or Consumer contract applicable to your interactions
with Consumers must clearly and conspicuously disclose that you and third-party partners (such as
us) may: (i) collect, use, and disclose Consumer personal information for the purpose of
communicating with the Consumer using any contact information the Consumer may provide, (ii) use
pixels and cookies to determine whether the Consumer responds to such communications and
interacts with web sites which may display the Reviews from time to time, and (iii) use and publish
information collected from the Consumer, and provide such information to other third parties for use
and publication, for the purpose of promoting Client products and services, and the Service. We
strongly recommend you review these requirements with your legal counsel to ensure that such
disclosures comply with the laws applicable to you and the manner in which you use our Service.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to provide similar disclosures, and obtain similar
consents and permissions, through direct communications with your Consumers.

### 4.3. Review Collection

In order to enable us to collect Reviews, Client must provide us with the Consumer data we require to
create and send out invitations to Consumers to provide a Review. We will attempt to contact and
request each Consumer for whom we receive contact information from Client to provide a Review,
utilizing email provided by Client. The Consumer will be prompted to provide a Review concerning
their purchase of a product or service from Client, or any other interactions they may have had with
Client, which we will collect within the Service. Client’s delivery of Consumer information to us
(including, without limitation, via the Net Reviews API), constitutes Client’s warranty that it has
obtained all necessary permission and consents from the Consumer to allow us to process the
Consumer’s data as required in order to deliver the Service that Client requests, and that the use of
such data by us to deliver the Service, including the publication and distribution of Consumer
information and the Reviews, shall not breach any applicable laws related to data privacy or rights of
publicity. Client shall indemnify and hold Net Reviews harmless from and against any and all claims
arising from or relating to Client’s failure to secure such legally binding consents from Consumers.

### 4.4. Processing Reviews

Upon receipt of a Review, the Service applies certain automatic machine-based filters, and in some
cases human review, to attempt to prevent publication of any personal information, content that would
be illegal, or would otherwise violate the applicable Guidelines for use of the Service we establish from
time to time. Please see Appendix 1 for our discussion of the moderation process. However, Net
Reviews shall not be liable, and Client hereby waives any rights to recover any damages or other
compensation from Net Reviews, on account of any Consumer Reviews published by the Service.

### 4.5. Communicating with Consumers

Client may use the Service to respond to Consumers and their Reviews, including providing thanks for
a Review, answering questions and addressing complaints, presenting your version of the facts (with
the possibility of attaching supporting information), and indicating any changes made to a product or
service since the Review was submitted. Consumers will generally have the opportunity to also
respond to Client. If Client has elected to have such Consumer communications publicly available,
such election shall apply to all such communications (subject to non-publication or removal due to a
legal concern or failure to comply with our applicable guidelines).
Client shall be solely responsible for its communications with Consumers utilizing the Service, and
shall comply with all laws and regulations applicable to such communications including, without
limitation, the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (as amended), and all obligations with respect to the retention
and updating of unsubscribe records, and timely fulfilling all unsubscribe requests. Without limiting the
foregoing, Client shall ensure that any communications through the Service with any Consumer or
other person shall not be of a commercial nature (as defined in the CAN-SPAM Act), and shall
indemnify and hold Net Reviews harmless from and against any and all claims arising from or relating
to Client’s unlawful communications with Consumers, including, without limitation, such
communications made utilizing the Service.


### 4.6. Displaying Reviews

In addition to utilizing Widgets on Client’s chosen web site, or otherwise publishing Reviews, Client
may also elect to enable the Service to provide Reviews and related information for publication on
third party sites, including Internet search engines with which Net Reviews will collaborate for the
purpose of such publications, from time to time (collectively, “Third Party Sites”). Client acknowledges
that Third Party Sites control the insertion of Review information (including overall rating, number of
stars and the number of Reviews gathered), and that under no circumstances will Net Reviews be
responsible for the actions or omissions of the Third Party Sites. For the avoidance of doubt, Net
Reviews makes no representation and gives no warranty in relation to any actions or omissions of
Third Party Sites. However, we do take seriously the performance or any failure in performance by any
third party and, should we become aware of such a failure, we will take commercially reasonable
efforts to correct such third party’s performance. Client may download copies of all Client Reviews at
any time during the term of its subscription for the Service and is advised that Net Reviews will only
retain a Consumer name in connection with a Review for a period of 18 months, after which the
Review will be anonymized and Client will no longer have the opportunity to obtain the Consumer
name in association with such Review; instead the Review shall be from “Anonymous.”

### 4.7. Availability

Net Reviews will endeavor to make the Service available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, excluding
such periods when the Service may be unavailable due to necessary maintenance, updates or other
factors, and unanticipated downtime. We anticipate that Service unavailability will be infrequent and of
limited duration and should we know that there will be any extended unavailability, we will use
reasonable efforts to provide advance notice to you. However, Net Reviews does not offer any
guaranty or warranty that the Service will be available at all times, or that it will continue to be offered
indefinitely.

### 4.8. Changes

You are advised that Net Reviews may elect to modify the Service from time to time, including
modifications to the Service’s functionality and substance. In addition, your purchase of a particular
subscription to the Service does not entitle you to use any other service we may offer that requires an
additional payment or contract terms, including future enhanced or similar versions of the service that
may replace the service you have paid to use. Net Reviews may make these modifications and cease
offering the Service from time to time, in its discretion.

## 5 - Working with Third Parties

Net Reviews utilizes various skilled third-parties (“Service Providers”) to provide technical or other
services relating to all or part of our fulfillment of the Service, and you hereby agree that such
involvement by these Service Providers is acceptable. Please see our Privacy Policy to understand
the extent to which any third-party may have access to Client or Consumer information.

## 6 - Protecting Client and Consumer Information

The protection of Client and Consumer information in the Service is a top priority for us so we will
maintain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized access,
use, modification, deletion and disclosure of Client and Consumer information by our personnel. We
will endeavor to only share Client and Consumer information in accordance with our Privacy Policy,
and only with third parties that maintain, at a minimum, reasonable data practices for maintaining the
confidentiality and security of Client and Consumer information and preventing unauthorized access.
However, Client acknowledges and agrees that Client and not Net Reviews bears sole responsibility
for adequate security, protection and backup of Client and Consumer information in the possession or
control of Client or its third-party service providers (including Client’s and such third-parties’ personnel


and other representatives or agents), or when Client chooses to use unencrypted gateways (e.g.,
IRC/XMPP clients) to connect to the Service.

## 7 - Payment Terms

### 7.1. Pricing

All subscriptions must be paid for in advance, and you must pay the amount we specify for the
applicable Service package. Payment obligations are non-cancelable and, except as expressly stated
in these Terms, fees shall be paid in US Dollars and are non-refundable. If we agree to invoice Client,
full payment must be received within one (1) week after receipt.
Client will be solely responsible for selecting a Service package based upon its anticipated volume of
Consumer reviews to be process by the Service, and any ancillary features Client wishes to obtain.
Certain Service pricing may include additional charges for any volume of Reviews that exceeds a
monthly maximum, in which event Client shall be charged for such additional Reviews. Net Reviews
shall not be liable for any inaccurate forecasting or Service package selection made by Client that
results in such additional charges. Client may obtain an invoice reflecting its fees and other charges in
Client’s Back Office.
Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any
nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any
jurisdiction (collectively, “Taxes”). You will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your
purchases, except for those taxes based on Net Reviews’ net income.
Our Service prices do not include any third-party fees you incur in connection with using the Service
including, without limitation, fees charged by your Internet access provider, any wireless carrier
charges for cellular or data services and any other third-party services with which you may use the
Service; you are responsible for selecting and managing these other services, and paying the fees for
such services.

### 7.2. Service Terms and Autorenewal

Unless an Order Form or Client’s agreement with Net Reviews provides otherwise, all subscriptions
will be for either a one-year term or one month term and shall automatically renew (without the need to
go through the Service-interface “check-out” or execute a renewal Order Form) for additional terms of
the same length of time. The Service package pricing during any automatic renewal term will remain
the same as it was during the immediately prior term unless we notify you prior to the end of the term
of a price increase. (See “Price Changes” below for information regarding price increases.) Either you
or we may notify the other by email to accounting@verified-reviews.com of non-renewal at least thirty
(30) days before the end of a subscription term to stop the subscription from automatically renewing.

### 7.3. Payment Methods

Net Reviews accepts certain debit and credit cards, and may also accept payment by bank transfer for
certain Service packages (each, an “Accepted Payment Method”), subject to the procedures and
rules contained in these Terms and any applicable contract with the Accepted Payment Method.
Accepted Payment Methods may vary by country or by certain features of the Service and may
change from time to time. When you purchase with an Accepted Payment Method, the fees for your
Service will be billed on or near the date of your purchase. You agree that we may process your
Accepted Payment Method on each monthly, annual, or other renewal term (based on the applicable
subscription term), on or near the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your Service
subscription, as applicable. See “Cancellation” below for information on how to cancel a Service
subscription.
In order to facilitate the charging and payment for your subscription, you agree that we have
permission to retain and/or share with financial institutions and payment processing firms (including
any institutions or firms we retain in the future) information regarding your purchase and your
submitted payment information in order to process your payment, and to use the email address
submitted by you to provide you with notices and disclosures relating to renewals and recurring


charges. See below for information describing what you must do to change your Accepted Payment
Method.

### 7.4. Price Changes

We may change the price of any Service from time to time, and add new fees and charges for certain
features or to reflect a change in business or legal rules, but we will provide you with advance notice of
changes in recurring subscription fees. Any increase in charges for the same Service would not apply
until the expiration of your then current subscription term, unless otherwise specifically provided in our
notice to you, and would become effective no sooner than the next time you would be charged for that
Service. If you are a monthly subscriber, Net Reviews will not increase your subscription fees more
frequently than once each twelve (12) months and by not more than five percent (5%). If you do not
agree to pay the new price or other applicable charges, you may elect not to renew the Service
subscription before the price change goes into effect, which cancellation would be effective at the
expiration of your then current subscription term. See “Cancellation” below for information on how to
cancel a Paid Service subscription.

### 7.5. Paying our Payment Processor

When you purchase the Service, you are granting Net Reviews the irrevocable right and permission
with respect to such purchase to provide your personal data and payment information to any third-
party payment processor we contract with (such as Braintree; Shopify or PayPal and/or one of its
financial service providers) on your behalf, and to grant such firm(s) (and/or one of their respective
financial service providers) the rights to collect, use, retain, and disclose such data and information. In
addition, you authorize Net Reviews to (i) obtain and verify your identity as necessary to complete
financial transactions, and (ii) determine your eligibility and authority to complete such purchase.
Please note that your obligation for payment to, and relationship with, such payment processor is a
contractual matter between you and such third-party; Net Reviews is not a party to, or responsible on
account of, such contract. While we select our payment processors carefully and enter into detailed
agreements imposing performance obligations (including confidentiality) on them, we cannot and do
not guarantee their performance.

### 7.6. Changes to Payment Methods and Account Information

You are responsible for ensuring that your account information, including your email address and all
payment information (address, debit or credit card number and expiration date), is accurate and up to
date. You may change this information at any time by accessing your Back Office and making the
changes or by contacting us by email at accounting@verified-reviews.com. If you have any difficulty
making any change to the payment method, you must notify us by contacting us by email at
accounting@verified-reviews.com and demonstrating to our satisfaction your authority to change the
payment method used for the Service.
If your credit card expires or the information is otherwise invalid, or you or another party controlling the
payment method make changes to your billing account too close in time to when we charge for the
Service subscription (so we cannot reasonably act on your changes prior to billing), we will probably
not be aware of this, and we will bill the current charges to the card we had on record; the continuation
of your Service subscription constitutes your authorization for us to do so, and you remain responsible
for any uncollected amounts and any charges incurred by you or us as a result of billing to an invalid
card.

### 7.7. Cancellation of a Service Subscription

You may elect to cancel your Service at any time and, except as otherwise provided in these Terms,
such cancellation will be effective as of the end of the then-current subscription term and no refund of
any prepaid fees will be provided to you. If you desire to cancel your subscription for the Service, you
must notify us by contacting us by email at accounting@verified-reviews.com and demonstrating to
our satisfaction your authority to cancel Client’s subscription. If you are using the Service during any
trial period without charge, you must cancel the Service prior to the end of the trial period in order to


avoid incurring the charges for the a paid subscription for the Service.
If you are the authorized legal representative for a legal entity that has been formally dissolved or
otherwise ceased to be authorized to act for its own account (without opportunity for revival), and you
wish to cancel a Service subscription for such Client, you must notify us by email at
accounting@verified-reviews.com and demonstrate to our satisfaction your authority to act on behalf
of Client and request cancellation of the Service. We will cancel the Service subscription if you
demonstrate to our satisfaction your legal authority to act and be legally responsible for such Client
and your ability to validate the details of the payment method used for such Service subscription.
We may cancel any Service subscription you have purchased if you fail to pay the applicable
subscription fees and any applicable Taxes in full and in a timely manner according to these Terms or
any agreement with a payment processor. A failure to pay occurs in any situation where Net Reviews
has not received timely payment, including where any credit card issuer or payer bank refuses to
transmit the funds that are then due, or the payment processor you have contracted with notifies us of
your failure to pay. We may, in our discretion, elect not to cancel a Service subscription immediately
for non-payment, in which case you will continue to be responsible for the fees due for the duration of
the applicable subscription. In addition, if you fail to pay for the Service, we may elect to suspend your
rights to use the Service. We will endeavor to provide you notice promptly after any failure to make a
payment to us in full and on time, but we are not obligated to do so.

### 7.8. Costs of Collection; Credit Card Chargebacks

In addition to the published fees for the Service, you agree to pay any reasonable costs we incur to
collect any unpaid or past due amounts, including reasonable attorneys' fees and other associated
costs. Delinquent payments will bear interest at the rate of 1% per month or the highest rate permitted
under applicable law, whichever is less, from the payment due date until paid in full.
If you purchase a Service subscription with a credit card and then subsequently request your credit
card issuer to reverse that payment, Net Reviews may be charged a fee. Accordingly, in order to
enable you to pay relatively minor fees with a credit card, you acknowledge and agree that we reserve
the right to suspend your ability to use the Service until such time as you reimburse us the amount of
the fee we were charged by the card issuer.

## 8 - Use of the Reviews

Client is free to use and publish the information provided in the Reviews as it wishes, during and after
the termination of Client’s subscription for the Service, provided that Client complies with these Terms.
Verified Reviews will reasonably cooperate with Client to enable Client to retrieve all of their Reviews
at the termination of its subscription. Verified Reviews may also freely use, reproduce, publish, make
available and translate the content of the Review forever throughout the world and in any media and
on any medium whatsoever, provided that Verified Reviews and Client agree that they shall only have
the right to use the pseudonym used by the Consumer in connection with the Review for a period of
eighteen (18) months. Verified Reviews will anonymize each Review eighteen (18) months after they
are submitted.

## 9 - Ownership of the Service

Net Reviews and its licensors exclusively own all rights, title, and interests in and to the Service,
including all proprietary technologies, software, methodologies, analytics, artificial intelligence, and
machine learning occurring as a result of your use of the Service, and provided or made available to
you by Net Reviews within, or in conjunction with, the Service, the Service Data (as defined below),
the Verified Reviews Brand Elements, and any enhancements, derivative works or improvements
thereto, except for the limited license granted to you to use the Service set forth below. You
acknowledge that the Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States
and other countries. You also agree not to develop or commercialize any product or service likely to
compete with the Service during the duration of the Service subscription and for a time period of three
(3) years following the termination of Client’s subscription.
Subject to the restrictions upon use or disclosure of Client and Consumer information set forth in these


Terms, Client agrees that Net Reviews may use information gathered in connection with the manner of
use of the Service by Authorized Users, Consumers, and others to improve the Service, and develop
other products and services, as long as such information is in a form that does not individually identify
Client or Consumer personal information (the “Service Data”).

## 10 - Grants of Rights by Client

Client hereby grants Net Reviews a non-exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-free license to
use, copy, modify, create derivative works based upon, distribute, display, perform and publish the
Client and Consumer information solely for the purpose of operating and providing the Service, and for
no other purpose. Client acknowledges and agrees that the licenses granted to Net Reviews in these
Terms may be extended by us to Third Party Sites and our Service Providers to the degree necessary
in order for the Service to be provided. Client allows, free of charge, the non-exclusive, non-
transferable, and non-transmissible right to use for the duration of their contractual relationship,
Client’s name, logo and other trade and service marks on the Verified Reviews Website and on pages
where Reviews are published, in connection with such Reviews. Client acknowledges and agrees that
Net Reviews may retain in its archive copies of all Reviews obtained during the term of Client’s
subscription for the Service after the termination of such subscription.

## 11 - Grants of Rights by Net Reviews

Net Reviews hereby grants to you a nontransferable, non-exclusive right to access and use the
Service, and to permit your Authorized Users to access and use the Service, in accordance with these
Terms, during the term of your subscription. Subject to Client’s Order Form, Net Reviews hereby
grants Client a nontransferable, non-exclusive right to use the Verified Reviews Brand Elements only
in the forms made available to Client by Net Reviews during the term of Client’s subscription to use the
Service, and subject to any usage guidelines published by Net Reviews from time to time.

## 12 - Feedback

If you provide to us any ideas, suggestions, and/or proposals relating to the Service (or other products
or services Net Reviews might develop) (all such communications to be referred to collectively as
“Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree: (i) Feedback does not contain confidential or proprietary
information; (ii) Net Reviews is not under any obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with
respect to any Feedback; (iii) Net Reviews shall be entitled to use or disclose (or choose not to use or
disclose) such Feedback for any purpose, in any way; (iv) Net Reviews may already have under
consideration or in development ideas similar to or the same as such Feedback; (v) your Feedback
automatically becomes Net Reviews’ property without any obligation to you; and (vi) you are not
entitled to any accounting, compensation or reimbursement of any kind from Net Reviews under any
circumstances. To be clear, Net Reviews shall be entitled to utilize all Feedback in any way without
restriction or obligation to you. Without limiting these rights, you hereby grant Net Reviews a perpetual,
worldwide, sublicensable, non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty free license under all of your intellectual
property rights to use without compensation or acknowledgment to you or others, any Feedback
provided to Net Reviews, including the rights to make and sell products and services based on such
Feedback.

## 13 - Support and Updates

While Net Reviews expects to provide updates to the Service from time to time, and guidance on how
to use the Service as it may be updated, Net Reviews shall not have any obligation to provide specific
support to you with respect to the use or modifications of the Service.
We may share information about future enhancements or other changes to the Service, but you should
not rely upon them when deciding to subscribe. Your decision to subscribe should be based upon the
functionality available when you are making that decision, and not on the potential future functionality.


## 14 - Suspension

We may suspend Client's access to or use of all or any part of the Service, without incurring any
liability, if:

- we receive a judicial or other governmental demand or order, subpoena, or law enforcement request
  that we determine requires us to do so; or
- we determine that: (i) there may be an imminent threat to the security of the Service or data therein;
  (ii) Client’s login credentials may have been compromised; (iii) Client has violated the restrictions on
  access or use of the Service; or (iv) suspension of access is necessary during any maintenance of the
  Service.
  Absent Client’s uncured breach of these Terms, any suspension shall be as short as reasonably
  possible and in no event longer than thirty (30) days. This Section does not limit any of our other rights
  or remedies, whether at law, in equity or under these Terms.

## 15 - Term and Termination

The term of your subscription and rights to use the Service will terminate on the earlier of (i) notice of
termination by Net Reviews to you, or you to Net Reviews, at any time. If Net Reviews terminates your
right to use the Service prior to the end of the then-current subscription term without cause (i.e., Client,
including its Authorized Users, is/are not in violation of these Terms), Net Reviews shall refund the
applicable pro rata portion of any fees paid by Client for the portion of the subscription term after the
date of termination. In all other circumstances, termination of the right to use the Service shall not
require any refund of subscription fees paid to Net Reviews.
If Client’s ability to access or use the Service is suspended or the subscription terminated, Client must
immediately cease all use of the Verified Reviews Brand Elements. Any wrongful use will result in the
right to impose an administrative fee of $125 per day and per Internet site (URL), without prejudice to
any damages and interest which Verified Reviews may claim as compensation. Client acknowledges
and agrees that such administrative fees are appropriate in light of the requirement for Verified
Reviews to monitor its proprietary rights and that such fees shall not be considered a penalty or
liquidated damages.
The rights and obligations under the sections of these terms entitled “Displaying of Reviews,” “Costs of
Collection; Credit Card Chargebacks,” “Use of the Reviews,” “Ownership of the Service,” “Feedback,”
“Warranties, Disclaimers and Limitations,” “Indemnification,” “Governing Law,” “Dispute Resolution,”
and “Miscellaneous,” (including all subsections under any bold-faced headings), the immediately
preceding paragraph, this paragraph, and all obligations accrued and unsatisfied as of the termination
of your subscription, shall continue to be binding notwithstanding the termination of your subscription.

## 17 - Indemnification by Client

Client will, upon request from Net Reviews, defend Net Reviews, its Service Providers, and its and
their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, the “ Net Reviews
Indemnified Parties”), against any and all third party claims, actions, suits, proceedings, and
demands (a “Third Party Claim”), and will indemnify and hold harmless the Net Reviews Indemnified
Parties from and against all liabilities, losses, damages, penalties, judgments, awards, settlements,
costs, and expenses including, without limitation, attorneys and other professional fees incurred in any
investigation or defense thereof (collectively “Losses”), arising from, in connection with, or relating to:
(i) Client or any of its Authorized Users’ actions or omissions that constitute a violation or breach of
these Terms or the User Requirements, including any of the warranties or representations made by
Client herein, and (ii) a Third Party Claim that asserts (a) the use of any Client name, trademark,
service mark or other brand elements by the Net Reviews Indemnified Parties in accordance with
these Terms infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party, (b) use of Consumer information
provided by Client infringes and/or violates applicable law and/or such Consumer’s right of privacy or
publicity, and/or (c) any communications sent or caused to be sent by Net Reviews on behalf of Client,
or by Client directly, violates any applicable law, rule or regulation.
We agree to provide Client with prompt written notice of any claim giving rise to an indemnification
obligation of Client, and cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting Client’s defense and
settlement of such matter, at Client’s cost, provided that any failure to provide such notice or
cooperate in such defense shall not eliminate any liability of Client hereunder, except to the extent that
such failure adversely affected Client’s ability to defend against such Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding anything contained in the immediately preceding paragraph, no settlement may be
entered into by Client without the express written consent of the Net Reviews Indemnified Parties
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), if (i) the third party asserting the claim is a
government agency, (ii) the settlement arguably involves the making of admissions by the Net
Reviews Indemnified Parties, (iii) the settlement does not include a full release of liability for the Net
Reviews Indemnified Parties, or (iv) the settlement includes terms other than a full release of liability
for the Net Reviews Indemnified Parties and the payment of money.

## 18 - Indemnification by Net Reviews


Net Reviews will indemnify, defend and hold Client and its officers, directors, employees, and agents,
harmless from and against any and all Losses arising out of any Third Party Claim alleging that the
Service infringes any U.S. patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret (an “Infringement Claim”);
provided, however, that Net Reviews shall not have any such indemnification obligations if the alleged
claim that gives rise to any Losses arises from or relates to: (i) any use or modification of the Service
by Client or any person acting for or on behalf of Client (including all Authorized Users) in a manner
outside the scope of any right granted pursuant to these Terms, (ii) a combination, operation or use of
the Service with other software, hardware or technology not provided by Net Reviews if the claim
would not have arisen but for such combination, operation or use, or (iii) any claim arising from or
relating to a misrepresentation or breach of Client’s warranties in these Terms.
Client shall provide Net Reviews prompt written notice of any Infringement Claim giving rise to an
indemnification obligation of Net Reviews, and cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting Net
Reviews’ defense and settlement of such matter, at Net Reviews’ cost, provided that any failure to
provide such notice or cooperate in such defense shall not eliminate any liability of Net Reviews
hereunder, except to the extent that such failure adversely affected Net Reviews’ ability to defend
against such Infringement Claim.
Notwithstanding anything contained in the immediately preceding paragraph, no settlement may be
entered into by Client without the express written consent of the Net Reviews Indemnified Parties
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), if (i) the third party asserting the claim is a

Reviews Indemnified Parties, (iii) the settlement does not include a full release of liability for the Net
Reviews Indemnified Parties, or (iv) the settlement includes terms other than a full release of liability

## 19 - Governing Law

These Terms, and any disputes arising out of or related hereto, will be governed exclusively by the
internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to its conflicts of laws rules or
the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.

## 20 - Dispute Resolution

### 20.1. Mediation

You and we agree that any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to these
Terms, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate (a
“Dispute”), shall be submitted to JAMS, or its successor, for mediation, and if the Dispute is not
resolved through mediation, then it shall be submitted to JAMS, or its successor, for final and binding
arbitration pursuant to the Arbitration Rules set forth below, in each case in Boston, Massachusetts.
Either party to a Dispute may commence mediation by providing to JAMS and the other party a written
request for mediation, setting forth the subject of the Dispute and the relief requested. The parties to
the Dispute will cooperate in good faith with JAMS and with one another in selecting a mediator from
the JAMS panel of neutrals and in scheduling the mediation proceedings within thirty (30) days after
being submitted to JAMS (the “Mediation Schedule”). The parties to the Dispute agree that they will
participate in the mediation in good faith and that they will share equally in its costs. All offers,
promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any
of the parties, their agents, employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator or any JAMS
employees, are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in
any arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise
admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its
use in the mediation.

### 20.2. Arbitration

Either party to a Dispute may initiate arbitration with respect to the matters submitted to mediation by
filing a written demand for arbitration at any time following the initial mediation session or at any time


following 45 days from the date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever occurs first
("Earliest Initiation Date"). The mediation may continue after the commencement of arbitration if the
parties to the Dispute so desire. At no time prior to the Earliest Initiation Date shall either side initiate
an arbitration or litigation related to this Agreement except to pursue a provisional remedy that is
authorized by law or by JAMS Rules or by agreement of the parties. However, this limitation is
inapplicable to a party if the other party refuses to comply with the Mediation Schedule. All applicable
statutes of limitation and defenses based upon the passage of time shall be tolled until 15 days after
the Earliest Initiation Date. The parties will take such action, if any, required to effectuate such tolling.

### 20.3. Arbitration Rules

Any arbitration initiated pursuant to this these Terms shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in
those Rules, before one arbitrator (unless the parties agree to use three arbitrators). The arbitration
shall be governed by the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16. The arbitrator shall not
have power to award damages in connection with any Dispute in excess of actual compensatory
damages and shall not multiply actual damages or award punitive damages, and each party hereby
irrevocably waives any claim to such damages. Each party (i) hereby irrevocably submits to the
jurisdiction of any federal or state court of located in Boston, Massachusetts for the purpose of
enforcing the award or decision in any such arbitration, (ii) hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, by
way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise, in any such suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is
not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above named courts, that its, his or her property is
exempt or immune from attachment or execution (except as protected by applicable law), that the suit,
action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the suit, action or
proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the award may not be enforced in or by such court,
and (iii) hereby waives and agrees not to seek any review by any court of any other jurisdiction which
may be called upon to grant an enforcement of the award of any such court. Each party to the Dispute
hereby agrees to take any action that is required under this Agreement or the Act to implement any
resolution of a Dispute determined by the arbitration including, without limitation, the execution and
delivery of any document authorizing action by the Company and any agreement affecting the Shares.
Each party hereby consents to service of process by notice according to these Terms. Each Party
agrees that its, his or her submission to jurisdiction and its, his or her consent to service of process
herein is made for the express benefit of the other parties hereto.

### 20.4. No Class Actions

You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or
a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions,
private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed. If this
specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Mandatory Arbitration Provisions"
section will be deemed void.

would prefer we not use you as a reference.

### 21.4. Force Majeure

Neither party hereto shall be liable for default or for delay in performance (other than for the payment
of fees due hereunder) due to cause beyond its reasonable control and without its fault or negligence,
including, without limitation, acts of God or nature, or of the public enemy, changes in applicable law or
any other act or order of government, fires, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, travel
embargoes, denial-of-service attacks, or delays or failures of suppliers that are not readily replaceable.
A party affected by any such event shall notify the other party and use its reasonable efforts to remove
the cause of delay and resume performing as soon as possible and to mitigate any default or delay. In
no event shall a party be liable for any damages attributable to non-performance due to any such
event.

### 21.5. Relationship of the Parties; No Third Party Beneficiaries

Client and Net Reviews are independent contractors. These Terms do not create a partnership,
franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between us. There are no third
party beneficiaries to these Terms.

### 21.6. Modifications

Net Reviews may change these Terms (other than an Order Form) at any time, in our sole discretion,
as new features, technology, or legal requirements arise, so please check back from time to time. If we
make a material change to these Terms, we will provide Client with reasonable notice prior to the
change taking effect, either by emailing the email address associated with Client’s account in the Back
Office or by messaging Client through the Service. Client can review the most current version of these


Terms at any time by visiting the Verified Reviews web site and by visiting the most current versions of
the other pages that are referenced in these Terms. Any material changes to these Terms will become
effective on the date set forth in our notice, and all other changes will become effective upon posting

unless set forth in a written agreement expressly amending these Terms and bearing a written
signature by you and us.

### 21.7. Waiver

that right. No waiver under these Terms will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an

# Appendix 1 - The Moderation Process

## 1 - Description of the Moderation Process

Moderation is a process prior or after the publication of a Review which aims to guarantee the
conformity of the collected content to the ISO 20488 standard as well as to the present Terms of
Service and to the User Requirements.
Verified Reviews undertakes to respect all these provisions in order to preserve the reliability of the
published Reviews, and will publish or reject Reviews when it is justifiable.


The rejection of a Review is necessarily the result of a manual action by the Verified Review
moderators following a report of the Review in question by the Client.
All stakeholders and actions related to Moderation are identified and traceable.
The Moderation service offered by Verified Reviews is included in any subscription to the Service. In
addition, Verified Reviews also offers a customized Moderation model that you may obtain in addition
to the standard version, subject to contracting with us.
The same Moderation period applies to all Reviews, whether positive or negative.

## 2 - Roles and Means of the Moderators

Moderation is carried out by computer tools and/or individuals who are generally referred to as
"moderators".
The capacities required and the means necessary for the person occupying the function of moderator
are:

- a perfect command of the language in which the Review was written, which mastery must have been
  objectively validated before taking up the position, equivalent to a level of "Mastery" of the Common
  European Framework of Reference for Languages (level C2 of the CEFR);
- access to the entire content of the Review;
- access to the identity of the writer (collected during the filing of Review) in order to be able to contact
  the writer if necessary;
- access to all information relating to the history of the Review submission (number of submissions of
  the same Review after initial rejection);
- access to the history of writer information (number of Reviews published, subject of previous
  Reviews); and
- the ability to observe previous Moderation of the Review by another moderator.

## 3 - Standard Moderation

The Moderation process is divided into two steps: an automatic moderation followed by a manual
Moderation.
In the automatic moderation, the following types of Reviews are filtered and placed in Moderation in
Client's Back Office:

- the Review score is equal to or less than 2 (which threshold that can be modified in Client's Back
  Office);
- the Review contains personal data that can be identified by the system;
- the Review contains insults or coarse language; or
- the Review text contains five identical characters.

Certain Reviews that are automatically placed in the moderation tab in Client’s Back Office are
automatically reported to the Verified Reviews Moderators for review if:

- the Review contains personally identifiable data that can be identified by the system; or
- the Review contains profanity.

After the automatic moderation, a manual moderation takes place, during which Clients may respond
to a Consumer submitting a Review or report to the Verified Reviews moderators those Reviews
considered problematic, and Verified Reviews moderators assess those Reviews reported by Clients
and the automatic moderation system.
This automatic and human moderation systems substantially diminish the potential publication of
Reviews that do not comply with the ISO 20488 standard, as well as the Terms of Service and User
Requirements. Thus, only after examining the reported Reviews, do the Verified Review moderators
decide whether to publish such reported Reviews.
The automatic moderation is done before the publication of the Reviews. However, the manual part is
available at any time from the Client's Back Office and can therefore be moderated after publication, if


necessary.
See below concerning the time limits for Moderation of Reviews.

## 4 - Optional moderation

Verified Reviews also offers a customized moderation operation at a price to be determined with
Client, allowing Client to discharge the manual moderation that is due to Client on the standard
moderation system. This customized option includes proofreading of the Reviews by the Verified
Reviews moderators, and Client must precisely structure its needs and requests in a specification.
Thus, Client will be able to specify the following, at its election:

- require a rereading of all the Reviews or only those corresponding to a criteria Client defines;
- set up predefined answers that Client will have provided according to the type of Review and Client’s
  criteria;
- configure the criteria for refusal enabling the moderators to act autonomously without prior validation
  by Client in compliance with the reasons for refusal listed below; and
- construct a categorization of the Reviews through a system of attribution of "Tags" specific to each
  Review (example: delivery, payment, Client service, etc.).

## 5 - Moderation Time Period

Verified Reviews will conclude the moderation for all Reviews, whether positive or negative, so that all
Reviews are published seven (7) days after the Review is submitted. However, it is possible that
certain moderations may extend up to fourteen (14) days due to extenuating circumstances. In
addition, extraordinary circumstances may require additional time delays, upon the express request of
the Client to its account manager, which requests shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by
Verified Reviews.

## 6 - Rejection of Client Reviews

Verified Reviews will inform the Consumer of the rejection of a Review and provide the reason for the
rejection. However, Verified Reviews is not required to specify the reasons for the rejection of a
Review that has been identified as artificially constructing or biasing the evaluation of the product or
service.
Reasons for Rejection of Consumer Brand Reviews:

- The Review is considered defamatory.
- The rating doesn’t reflect the comment.
- The Review relates to a product/service, not the shopping experience on the Client’s store.
- The text contains random characters or is so badly written that it is incomprehensible.
- Information describing the shopping experience has not been provided.
- The Review is determined to be intended to skew a product or Client’s average rating.
- The Review content bears no relation to what is being rated.
- The Review contains personal information or some other information that could facilitate identity
  theft, such as the individual names, phone number, address, credit card, social security, or bank
  account numbers, or any other information that is conducive to identity theft.
- The Review encourages readers to buy from a competitor.
- The Review indicates that the user has not experienced shopping with this Client.
- The Review contains insults or swearing.
- The Review’s attributes contain evidence of conflicts of interest.
- A user is leaving an inappropriate comment about another Review or its writer.
- The Review is clearly spam or mentions websites or URLs, including those of the Client or
  manufacturer.
- The Review contains a call to take legal action.
- The after sales service resolved the Consumer’s problem, and the Consumer wishes to update the


Review.

- The Consumer reached out to the Client in order to modify or delete the rating and Review.

Verified Reviews will give the Consumer the opportunity to submit a new Review following the
rejection of his/her first Review during the moderation process; up to a maximum of three (3) Reviews.

## 7 - Editing and Modification

Verified Reviews will not modify or delete content of a Review, such as correcting spelling mistakes,
changing user pseudonyms, or hiding or deleting text, other than inserting alternative characters in
place of names or numbers in Reviews in order to respect the confidentiality of Personal Data.

## 8 - Publication of Reviews

Verified Reviews displays all Reviews in their entirety, whether positive or negative, if they have not
been rejected during the moderation process. Reviews are published chronologically from the most
recent to the oldest based on the date the Review was submitted, with at least the following
information:

- the date and time the Review was submitted;
- the date of the Consumer’s experience;
- the Review writer’s first name and first letter of their surname.

Verified Reviews may also display the product or service purchased and the place of purchase.
Verified Reviews may display below each Review the Client’s right of reply.

## 9 - Review Scoring

Verified Reviews transparently displays on its Attestation page the average score for each of its
Clients collected over a period of one (1) year on a rolling basis. Verified Reviews does not aggregate
or weight ratings. Reviews are kept for a period of five (5) years in the Verified Reviews Database.
Verified Reviews determines the average score using the following calculation: average score = (sum
of the scores in the published Reviews / total number of published Reviews).
The score is calculated as follows:

- Calculation of the average, to five (5) digits after the decimal point, of all the scores of the published
  Reviews;
- to have a score out of 5: this average, to five (5) digits after the decimal point, is rounded to one digit
  after the decimal point;
- for a score out of 10: this average, to five (5) digits after the decimal point, is multiplied by two (2) and
  then rounded to one (1) digit after the decimal point.

## 10 - Reporting Illegal or Inappropriate Reviews

Verified Reviews allows for the reporting of a Review with illegal or inappropriate content by email to
moderation@verified-reviews.co.uk or by submitting information via the Client’s Attestation Page.

## 11 - Client’s Right of Reply

Verified Reviews enables the Client being evaluated the opportunity to respond at any time to a
Review through its Back Office. The Client may:


- thank the Consumer for the Review;
- respond to questions in the Review;
- respond to the comments in the Review (with the possibility of filing attachments); and
- indicate any changes that may have been made to the product or service since the Review was
  written.

The Client responses are displayed below the relevant Reviews. The Consumer will receive an email
informing them of any message relating to his/her Review sent by the Client. The Consumer will be
able to reply without being able to modify his/her rating. The Client will likewise be informed of
messages left by Consumers on its products and/or services. These various exchanges will be visible
publicly online, unless the Client has elected to communicate privately with the Consumer.
This procedure enables a Client to engage with the Consumer when a Review seems unjustified.
Verified Reviews does not interfere with, and accepts no responsibility for, any such communications
between the Client and the Consumer. Clients and Consumers are solely responsible for managing
any difficulty that may arise from the submission of a Review and any further communications relating
to such Review.

## 12 - Consumer Bans

Verified Reviews reserves the right to exercise its discretion in banning a writer of a Review that is
determined to contain illicit or inappropriate content as a result of the moderation process, or where
such writer otherwise violates the User Requirements, and may remove all Reviews from such writer.

## 13 - Rights of Verified Reviews and the Client in Reviews

Consumers who submit a Review, or any additional communication related to such a Review or a
Client response thereto, agree that Verified Reviews and the Client may freely use, reproduce,
publish, make available and translate the content of the Review forever throughout the world and in
any media and on any medium whatsoever, provided that Verified Reviews and its Client shall only
have the right to use the pseudonym used by the Consumer in connection with the Review for a period
of eighteen (18) months. Verified Reviews will anonymize each Review eighteen (18) months after
they are submitted.
